# Developer Onboarding

The goal of this repository is to provide resources for new developers at the Hesburgh Libraries.

## Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Your text editor is a personal experience and something to consider.
It is also something you should be prepared to invest energy in learning more about.

At the Hesburgh Library the following text editors are used:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/)

If you don't have experience with `vim` it is a harder tool to learn.
However `vim` is available on most every remote machine that you would log into.
At some point you'll want a passing familiarity with `vim`.
There are extensive plugins.

Atom is a great choice as it is open-source and free.
It is built on web technologies (i.e. HTML, CSS, and JS).
There are extensive plugins / often under rapid and perhaps volatile development.

Sublime Text is under active development but is not open-source nor free.
We can get a license if you are interested.
There are extensive plugins.

RubyMine is an IDE. Its much more heavy weight but provides the power of an IDE.
You will still want a text editor, because sometimes you will need lightweight text editing.

## Training Resources

These are some free and excellent walk-through resources.

## Bootstrapping

In our ideal world we would have a single script to run to install/launch a given development context.
In some cases we have VMs that can be spun up for development.
