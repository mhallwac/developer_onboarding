# Coding Challenges

Open up a terminal, and `cd` into the `developer_onboarding/ruby` directory.
Then run the following command `bundle install`.
This will ensure that you have RSpec installed on your machine.

Starting with the `developer_onboarding/ruby/coding-challenges/deck_of_cards.rb`, get the RSpec suite running.
See the comments in `deck_of_cards.rb` for more specific instructions.

In this case the "production" code and the "test" code are in the same file.
Most of the work we do will separate each class (i.e. `Card` and `Deck`) into separate files.
We also separate the "test" code from the "production" code, with one spec file per class.
More on that later.
